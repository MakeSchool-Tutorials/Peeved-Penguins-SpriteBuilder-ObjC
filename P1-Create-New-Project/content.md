Let's start the work on our game by creating a new SpriteBuilder project:

![Create new project in Spritebuilder](./1-Spritebuilder_NewProject.png "Create new project in Spritebuilder")

Name your new project “PeevedPenguins”. Once the project is created, open Finder and take a look at the folder structure of your project. If you can't find your project in Finder, search for it using Spotlight at the top right of your screen. The folder structure should look something like this:

![Spritebuilder file system](./2-Spritebuilder_Filesystem.png "Spritebuilder file system")

SpriteBuilder created a new folder (PeevedPenguins.spritebuilder). Inside it are a SpriteBuilder project (PeevedPenguins.ccbproj) and a new Xcode project (PeevedPenguins.xcodeproj).

The default SpriteBuilder project comes with one scene (MainScene). Your empty project should look like this:

![Spritebuilder empty project](./3-Sprtebuilder_EmptyProject.png "Spritebuilder empty project")

##Testing your setup
Let’s make sure everything was generated correctly. Click the publish button (on left side of the toolbar) in SpriteBuilder:

![Publish in Spritebuilder](./4-Spritebuilder_Publish.png "Publish in Spritebuilder")

Now open PeevedPenguins.xcodeproj to view the project in Xcode. Run this on the iPhone simulator and verify it shows the “SpriteBuilder” message:

![Xcode Launch](./5-Spritebuilder_Xcode_Launch.png "Xcode Launch")

Congratulations! Now you have run your first SpriteBuilder project and you know your tools are working.
